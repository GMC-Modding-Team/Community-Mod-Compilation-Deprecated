                    Core files successfully installed!


    The core files include:
     - Lowering of basegame building spawn rates
     - Some structures won't have streets anymore (labs, radio towers, fema camps, transformer stations and sais,
        hazardous waste sarcophagi, military bunkers and silos)
        This change can be revoked in the next installation step.
     - Some basegame buildings will (sometimes) spawn outside of cities and villages
        (abandoned stores, bars, churches, dinners, gun shops, houses and police stations)
     - The possibility for larger forests to spawn
     - New buildings variations and types:
        New basements, allotments, butcheries, bakereries, explosion sites, small groves, abandoned homesteads, new
        LMOE basements, empty lots, small orchards, a plaza, public toilets, a lot of different studio flats and a
        warehouse.


                    Now we need to configure some settings.
