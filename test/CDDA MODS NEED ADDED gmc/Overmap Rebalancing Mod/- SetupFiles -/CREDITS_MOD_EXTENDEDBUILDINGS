    Thank you for your fantastic work! :)

    CONTENT - LET'S HEAR THE AUTHOR:

    EXTENDED BUILDINGS - Basically, I've just been adding some custom buildings to the mapgen.
    VFW Hall / Daycare Center / Thrift Store / Pet Supply Store / Storage Units (3x1) / Baseball Field (2x2) / Rest
    Area (2x2) / a not finished but still implemented Shopping Plaza (6x2)
    Note: Some buildings loot tables not correctly set/placed.
    I realize some of these are somewhat pointless in terms of adding to actual gameplay, my main focus is just making
    a robust selection of buildings for whoever wants 'em. (VERY MINIMAL New furniture, Cat Towers, Dog Kennels) I'll
    be updating this periodically.
