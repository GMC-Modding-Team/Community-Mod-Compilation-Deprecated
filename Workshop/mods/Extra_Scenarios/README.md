Extra Scenarios for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead


This is a simple add-on that introduces several new Scenarios all of which give the player more starting location options in more varied
interesting locations. Some are of the challenging variety, some come with their own thematic professions, and some simply give the   
player a neat location to start at. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~ *Spoilers* ~
The following is a brief description of the different scenarios along with why they were created.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-Shipwreck-
Allows player to start the game at a shipwreck, and play as a Sailor who starts with apporiate skills. Simple enough.


-Lost and Found -
Challenge scenario. Start in end room of Strange Temple allowing player to start game with an Artifact or two. Start as a new profession 
that forces to the player to start with nothing, besides stuff chosen at creation. Idea is to let you start the game with an artifact, but 
of course you will have to earn it by fighting way out of Temple.


-Cashing Out-
Challenge Scenario. Surrounded start at the Bank as a bank manager who has talking skills. Like the firestation scenario only at a bank.


-Ghost in the Dark-
Shady Basement start, only start as an Ex-con who comes with some fighting skills, and good night vision. Idea is to let one start with 
solid nightvision in a shady basement for fun, but at the cost of light sensitivity.


-Harvest Sun-
Abandon Barn Start as a farmer. For those who want to try a harvest moon roleplay run.


-Ritual-
Cathedral Basement start as a cultist. Allows the player to start in cathedral basement for fun, but have to play a cultist who comes
with just about nothing but two thematic traits.


-Little Shop of Horrors-
Start off in an antique store or pawn shop. For those who want to try a roleplay run as a shopkeeper. Title just a fun reference.


-Gun Shop-
Challenge Scenario. Surrounded start in a gun shop as a gunstore owner who has skills, but starts with whatever spawns in his shop.


-Backdraft-
Challenge Scenario. Fire & drunk start at a delerict property or campground that could put you in the middle of nowhere. For those who
want the bad day scenario without the infection & city start. Can play any profession.


-Machanically Yours-
Start off at a Garage or Public works as a mechanic. For those who want to start in either of these places for fun or item hunting.


-World below-
Challenge Scenario. Start off in the subway underground with nightvision & light sensititvity. For those who want a subway start. The
challenge comes from light sensitivity, and not knowing where the game put you subway wise.


-Marshland Monster-
Challenge Scenario. Start off in swamp as a Plant monster. For those who want a swamp start, and a little challenge that comes with being
a plant monster. Start with some positive & negative plant mutations, and nothing else.


-Bar Room Blitz-
Challenge Scenario. Surrounded drunk start in a bar. For those who want bar starts. Your profession does get some starting weapons, but
challenge is the surrounded & drunk flag.


-Short Circuit-
Challenge Scenario. Start off in a junkyard type location as a profession with a couple of good & bad cbms.


-Half Shell Ninja-
Get to spawn in Sewers as a half shell ninja. Can pick from 4 professions that aren't inspired by anything turtle related i swear.


-Strange Cabin-
Lets you start off in a strange cabin in the middle of nowhere with a couple of weapons thats not inspired by a certain horror movie.


-Patient Zero-
Challenge Start. Start off in a Feema Camp as a profession that has mutations chosen to create the story that you are playing as a half
zombie. Lets you have a Feema Camp start. The mutations chosen are ones I feel help represent a half zombified human that becomes a
hunter of the dead. (Had to choose what i could given there's no zombie mutation tree yet.) Think daywalker only for zombies. Challenge
comes from some of the negative traits of being a zombie like slow movement, and hunger. Title is chosen because I was aiming for a 
patient zero scenario where you play as someone who started changing before the cataclysm started. The idea of starting in a Feema camp
is so its not just another lab start, but one of the first people going through checkpoints that got quarantine when things started to
hit the fan.
