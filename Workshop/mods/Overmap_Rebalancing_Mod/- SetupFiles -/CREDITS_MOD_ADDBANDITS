    Thank you for your fantastic work! :)

    CONTENT - LET'S HEAR THE AUTHOR:

    This is a mod that does just what the title states: It add people (some with guns) into the game who try to kill
    you. Simple enough. This mod was mostly just a test to see how this whole modding thing worked out, but then I
    decided to pour more time into it, and here we are.
    This mod adds a new faction of human enemies who generally spawn within the cities or around potentially useful
    buildings outside of them. Better yet, they grow in strength over time much like the zombies and hopefully provide
    a constant challenge in the cities that's a little more different than the average stuff you'd normally run into.
    The key here is that a great deal of these guys are toting guns, so it might throw off the balance a bit. Just a
    warning. If you have any pointers on how to balance these guys out more, I'd be more than happy to hear them.
    As for the future of this mod, I do want to try my hand at adding buildings, maybe a bandit leader, and look into
    how "DOGFOOD" and "PHEROMONE" work to see if we could get some disguises or mercenaries in the future. Until then,
    enjoy the mod and if you have any tips, criticisms, or feedback, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
    Happy Huntings.
