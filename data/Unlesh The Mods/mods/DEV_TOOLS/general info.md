#ids guide
In the "ids of (...).md" files contains lists of the items and monsters
in those lists the ids are divide in "id", "name" and "number of codeline"
	the "name" are the in-game names, what the player reads
	the "id" is the code name of the objetc, used in programming
	and the "number of codeline" is the number where's the id of the object
	
And the lists are subcategorize in sub titles with a #name like:
#items/monsters/corpses

Every title represents a .json file in a specific folder of each mod with objects
so every objetc or monster of the Modular Turrets mod are in the "ids of Modular Turrets"

Some .md files contains not the full list of every object of a mod, sometimes it's divide in two
like for example the Civilian Robots and Modified Robots lists
it's because those two comes from the same mode but in diferent folders
it's just a way to categorize content of a mod easier

some items at the end of their line have the word: "(abstract)"
that means the object is not a actual object that the game recognize but the code it contains yes
a small thing that one shouldn't worry too much about but it's good to know if you're going to programm something based on my mods
